# The influence of resonant and non-resonant modes in the exciton dynamics
Recent observations of oscillatory characteristics in the optical response of photosynthetic complexes have revealed evidence of surprisingly long-lasting electronic coherences that can coexist with energy transport. These observations have sparked multidisciplinary interest in the role of quantum effects in biological systems, including the fundamental question of how electronic coherence can survive in biological environments. In this Master Thesis we show that the non-trivial spectral structures of protein uctuations can generate disequilibrium processes that lead to the spon-
taneous creation and maintenance of electronic coherence. Specically through the presence of discrete modes which are resonant with the energy dierence between excitons. Numerical simulations of systems with 1 and 2 modes will be carried out, and one of the modes of each system will be varied to observe the behavior of quantum coherence.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Matlab should be install in order to run the codes.
* A CPU cluster is necessary in order to execute the program in a reasonable amount of time.
